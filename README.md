# my-maven-project
Prerequisites:

    JDK 8 or later: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later installed on your system.

    Maven: Ensure that Maven is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Apache Maven website.

    Code Editor: Use your favorite code editor. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is recommended but not mandatory.

Step 1: Maven Installation

If you haven't already, install Maven by following the instructions on the official Maven website. After installation, verify that Maven is correctly installed by running the following command in your terminal: mvn -version

Step 2: Java Project Creation

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Java project.

    Create a new directory for your project
    Change into the project directory
Step 3: Create a Simple Java Application

    Inside your project directory, create a subdirectory structure for your Java code:mkdir -p src/main/java/hello
Create a Java source file inside the hello directory. You can use any text editor or IDE for this. For example, using VS Code
In WordLengthCalculator.java, write the following simple Java code 
Step 4: Create a pom.xml File

    In your project root directory, create a pom.xml file 
    Open the pom.xml file in a text editor and add the following minimal Maven configuration 
    This pom.xml file defines the project's basic information and specifies that it uses Java 8 as the source and target compatibility. 
 Step 5: Build the Java Project Using Maven

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to your project root directory (the one containing pom.xml).

    Run the following Maven command to build your project 
    Maven will compile your Java code, run any tests (there are no tests in this simple project), and create a JAR file containing your application. 
    Step 6: Test Your Build

    After a successful build, you can run your Java application by executing the following command from the project directory 
    Replace my-maven-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar with the actual JAR file name generated by Maven if it's different.

Enter a word when prompted, and the program will display the length of the entered word
